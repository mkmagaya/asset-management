# Asset Management System (Django, Streamlit, PostgreSQL)

This is an Asset Management System built with Django, Streamlit, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to manage assets such as laptops, desktops, and other hardware by storing and processing information about them. The system includes features for adding, updating, and viewing assets, and is designed to integrate with PostgreSQL for data storage and Streamlit for a web-based interface.

## Project Structure

- **Django**: Handles the backend and database operations, including models, migrations, views, and templates.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a simple and interactive web interface for users to add and view assets.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for persistent storage of asset data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Django 5.1+
- Streamlit 1.0+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL integration)

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Database Configuration (PostgreSQL)

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and a database created for the asset management system. You can configure the PostgreSQL database connection in `settings.py` of your Django project.

In `settings.py`, update the `DATABASES` configuration to use PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'logistics_db',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'admin',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Apply Migrations

Run the following command to apply the database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Starting the Django Development Server

To start the Django server and interact with the backend, use:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django admin interface can be accessed at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).

### Streamlit Interface

To run the Streamlit app for asset management, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The Streamlit interface will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8501](http://127.0.0.1:8501), where you can add and view assets interactively.

### Adding an Asset

When adding an asset via the Streamlit interface, the following information is required:

- **Asset Name**: Name of the asset (e.g., laptop model).
- **Assigned User**: Name of the person the asset is assigned to (if any).
- **User Company**: The company associated with the asset.
- **Device Type**: Either "Laptop" or "Desktop".
- **Asset Code**: (Optional) A unique code for identifying the asset.
- **Product Number**: Product number for the asset.
- **Serial Number**: Serial number of the asset.
- **Domain ID**: Automatically generated based on asset details.
- **Additional Information**: Any extra details about the asset.
- **Keyboard, Monitor, Mouse**: Relevant for desktops to specify peripherals.

Once the asset is added via the Streamlit app, it will be stored in PostgreSQL and can be viewed in the Django admin interface.

### Viewing Assets

Assets can be viewed through the Streamlit interface or the Django admin panel. The admin interface allows you to perform CRUD operations on the assets.

### Sample Domain ID Generation

The domain ID for assets follows this format:
```
<Company Abbreviation>-<Device Type>-<Department Abbreviation>-<Last 4 Characters of Serial Number>
```

Example:
- **TXX-L-ICT-9F6G**: TXX (Company), L (Laptop), ICT (Department), 9F6G (Last 4 characters of serial number).

## Troubleshooting

- **Django migrations**: If you encounter issues with migrations, ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and the connection parameters in `settings.py` are correct.
- **Streamlit not running**: Ensure that the `app.py` file is present in your project directory and that all dependencies are installed.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, submit issues, and send pull requests if you'd like to contribute to the project. Contributions are welcome!

### Future Features

- Integration with other asset management systems.
- Advanced reporting on asset usage.
- Asset lifecycle tracking (e.g., depreciation, end-of-life).
- User roles and permissions for asset management.
